### Website Fix

[Here's my PR.](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/75)

First, I cloned the repo locally using `git clone https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18.git`. My issue was pretty simple - I found the syllabus markdown page and located the incorrect link (a link that was supposed to be to the Daily page was actually just linking back to the syllabus). I fixed the link (to "daily.html" not "syllabus.html").

I created a new fork on which to save my work (not a branch, since we don't have write access to the repo), and added it to my local repo: `git remote add felix https://github.com/felixplajer/cs480_s18.git`. I committed my change and pushed it to my fork:
```
git add *
git commit -m "fixed link to Daily"
git push felix
```

I wanted to test the site before I made a PR but I didn't want to bother with running it locally, so I figured out I could use [my fork's Github Pages site](https://felixplajer.github.io/cs480_s18/) from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/q/8587321). I waited a bit until my change showed up on my forked copy of the website. Once it was there, everything seemed to be working!

I went to make a pull request to the main repo when I noticed that my text editor had automatically trimmed trailing whitespace off of a bunch of lines in the syllabus.markdown file. There weren't any ill effects but it didn't seem like good form to include unnecessary changes, so I went ahead and changed that stuff back (that took two commits because I missed some indentation changes the first time around). Lesson learned - don't have your text editor set to trim whitespace and fix indentation if you're only trying to make a small change to a project you don't own!

After double-checking that my test site was still working right, I finally actually made [a PR](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/75).

### Code Triage

I signed up for [freecodecamp/guides](https://www.codetriage.com/freecodecamp/guides) and [habitrpg/habitica](https://www.codetriage.com/habitrpg/habitica) at first, and later [webcompat/web-bugs](https://www.codetriage.com/webcompat/web-bugs) and [atom/atom](https://www.codetriage.com/atom/atom).

I started with a few issues I got from Habitica: 

- [This one](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/issues/8672) has a long history, and there's a pull request fixing it currently open (waiting for some changes), so there didn't seem to be anything I could add there.

- [This issue](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/issues/9748) is newer, but it's also well-described and someone quite recently indicated they were going to work on it, so there wasn't really anything left to "triage".

- [Yet another one](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/issues/9899) that looked well taken care of already. Someone indicated they'd work on it, and it's only been a few days since the last comment so it seems to be all good for now.

I was looking at Habitica issues because I've actually used it before, but it seemed like all the issues I was getting were already taken care of, so I switched to looking at the other projects. I also kept getting pull requests as well as issues until I figured out how to change that in the CodeTriage settings.

I ended up commenting on two Atom issues:

- [In this issue](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16771) I saw that the original author hadn't followed Atom's issue template (and so hadn't provided enough information to really see what the problem was) so I suggested that they do so.

- [This issue](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16776) was pretty similar - the author only gave a title and didn't fill out the issue template. I made the same suggestion to them.

Overall, I think CodeTriage is a nice way to find projects that are welcoming and have a lot of open issues, but most of the issues I got sent seemed to be past the triage stage - they already had people working on them or discussing them. Plus, I like to keep the number of emails I get to a minimum :)
