## Code Triage

I signed up for [freecodecamp/guides](https://www.codetriage.com/freecodecamp/guides) and [habitrpg/habitica](https://www.codetriage.com/habitrpg/habitica) at first, and later [webcompat/web-bugs](https://www.codetriage.com/webcompat/web-bugs) and [atom/atom](https://www.codetriage.com/atom/atom).

I started with a few issues I got from Habitica: 

- [This one](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/issues/8672) has a long history, and there's a pull request fixing it currently open (waiting for some changes), so there didn't seem to be anything I could add there.

- [This issue](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/issues/9748) is newer, but it's also well-described and someone quite recently indicated they were going to work on it, so there wasn't really anything left to "triage".

- [Yet another one](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/issues/9899) that looked well taken care of already. Someone indicated they'd work on it, and it's only been a few days since the last comment so it seems to be all good for now.

I was looking at Habitica issues because I've actually used it before, but it seemed like all the issues I was getting were already taken care of, so I switched to looking at the other projects. I also kept getting pull requests as well as issues until I figured out how to change that in the CodeTriage settings.

I ended up commenting on two Atom issues:

- [In this issue](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16771) I saw that the original author hadn't followed Atom's issue template (and so hadn't provided enough information to really see what the problem was) so I suggested that they do so.

- [This issue](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16776) was pretty similar - the author only gave a title and didn't fill out the issue template. I made the same suggestion to them.

Overall, I think CodeTriage is a nice way to find projects that are welcoming and have a lot of open issues, but most of the issues I got sent seemed to be past the triage stage - they already had people working on them or discussing them. Plus, I like to keep the number of emails I get to a minimum :)
