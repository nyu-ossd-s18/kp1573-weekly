### My Contributions "This Week"

This'll be an overview of all my contributions so far:

#### To the course website:

1. I reported [an issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/11) with the formatting of a link on the course website.
2. I fixed [an issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/13) on the course website - a link going to the wrong place - and submitted [a PR](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/75).
3. I commented on [an issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/24#issuecomment-365142474) for the course website, because I thought that part of it wasn't actually a problem.
4. I commented on [another issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/38#issuecomment-365333954) for the course website about the exam dates - once the midterm date was announced I said we could add that to the site.
5. I commented on a course website [issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/42#issuecomment-365140990) about a typo, because part of the reported typo was actually grammatically correct already.
