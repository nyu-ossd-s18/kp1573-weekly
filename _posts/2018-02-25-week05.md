### Open Source Project Questions

#### What type of things are you looking for when you select an open source project to work on?
I'm looking to see if their issue tracker has issues specifically marked for newbies, and if some are new-ish and unclaimed. This gives a sense of whether there's somewhere for me to start on the project as a beginner. I'm also checking whether the project is related to a topic I know something about, or if it's completely new territory - do I need to have a lot of background knowledge to get started? Also important is whether I'm actually interested in what the project is trying to accomplish.

#### What are you able to offer to the team that you will be working on for the project?
I see myself as a hard worker, and I value keeping my commitments - if I say I'll do some work then I'll make sure it gets done. I'm also not afraid to try and figure something out by diving into the documentation or code - I find it easy to work independently when that's required.

#### What are you hoping to learn from working on an open source project?
I want to learn how to get started in a project that I have no previous knowledge on - how do I efficiently learn about the existing codebase and how everything works and fits together, so that I can start to actually contribute something back? It's a bit intimidating as a beginner to go to a project with many regular contributors and figure out how to make yourself useful. I'm also hoping that I'll find I like working on open source projects in my spare time - maybe this'll turn into a new hobby?

#### What are you most worried about when you are thinking about and planning to work on an open source project?
I'm worried that I will be at a loss of where to start. Even when we were looking at "beginner" issues in class, it seemed like there was a lot of knowledge about the codebase necessary to tackle those. I'm also a bit of a shy person, so reaching out to other contributors to ask for help makes me a bit nervous :)

### My Contributions "This Week"

This'll actually be an overview of all my contributions so far:

#### To the course website:

1. I reported [an issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/11) with the formatting of a link on the course website.
2. I fixed [an issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/13) on the course website - a link going to the wrong place - and submitted [a PR](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/75).
3. I commented on [an issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/24#issuecomment-365142474) for the course website, because I thought that part of it wasn't actually a problem.
4. I commented on [another issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/38#issuecomment-365333954) for the course website about the exam dates - once the midterm date was announced I said we could add that to the site.
5. I commented on a course website [issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/42#issuecomment-365140990) about a typo, because part of the reported typo was actually grammatically correct already.

#### To Wikipedia:
