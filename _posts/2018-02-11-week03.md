I found the [Wikipedia Task Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Task_Center) from a page about contributing to Wikipedia. From there I found [a list of articles in need of copyediting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit). I clicked around to a few random pages and found an article that had an obvious error in one of its section titles.

After fixing the capitalization of the "Awards" section, I noticed some problems with the artist's name in the infobox. I added the name to the top of the infobox and updated the image caption to reflect how the name was spelled in the article's main text. At that point I took a closer look at the text of the article and realized it was a mess! I made some edits to fix spacing and capitalization issues in the intro and first section. There are more problems with grammar and the general style in which the article is written, but those require some more involved editing.

Here's the link to [my contribution page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Felixplajer).
In case I make any more edits in the future, here's [the specific revision I'm talking about](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keikhosro_Khoroush&oldid=825214340).
