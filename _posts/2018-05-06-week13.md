### Course Reflection

I learned a lot about the specifics of open source projects (what licenses are, history of open source, etc), but mostly importantly the course helped push me over that first-contribution hurdle. I feel like I'm more ready + likely to contribute to open source projects in the future now.

If I could remove/change something from the course, I think I'd change some of the lecture topics - for instance, I think most people already knew a lot about git (except about forks) so it was a bit boring to spend a whole class on it. It's tough to think of exactly what to add. I felt like we jumped into the group project a bit suddenly - maybe add some more time to the choosing-a-project phase, or give the opportunity to switch projects/groups after the initial presentations.
