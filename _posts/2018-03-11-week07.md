### Open Data Week

I went to the Data Through Design exhibit last Saturday (3/3). [Here's me there](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mqm4wHmAABGsZrZsEIxYaZAiFIBsaoxk/view?usp=sharing).

It was a small exhibition of projects people had made using publicly available NYC data. Some of the pieces were: 
- a wood model of Manhattan representing the types and amounts of trees in the borough
- a display with strings hanging over a map of the city to show where certain types of minor crimes occur most prevalently
- a display that tracked through 24 hours and lit up at the time of day that any sexual assault had been reported in 2016
- see-through layered maps of where fatal traffic accidents had occured in the past few years
- a machine that generated and printed out haikus based on NYC government job descriptions when you pressed a button

I really liked the haiku machine - it felt more interactive than the other pieces and generated some really interesting and funny results. It's cool to see people using public data to make art like this, and it makes me want to see what other data is available. My only criticisms are that one of the exhibits (on causes of death) wasn't working when I went there, and it was a pretty small exhibit.

I only went to this one event - I couldn't make it to the BUGS meeting because of a lab for another class, I registered to go to an event on Wednesday ([here's my ticket for verification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nqKMFhZ8L0YqmppQOGeZeF84Pyhaj3sm/view?usp=sharing)) which was postponed (new date still TBA) because of the storm, and I left Thursday evening for break so I didn't get to go to anything else.
