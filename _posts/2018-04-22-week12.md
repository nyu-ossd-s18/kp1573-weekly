### Team Progress

We finished our work on issue #4514 and submitted a pull request to the Moment repo. I specifically helped fix the last of the tests that weren't running correctly. We (actually Jason) also submitted a PR to the separate Moment website repo to update the documentation related to our PR.

We're pretty much done now! If anyone makes any comments on our PR, we'll address those, but otherwise we're just working on the presentation at this point.
