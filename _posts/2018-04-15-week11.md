### Team Progress

We're still working on issue #4514. It was pretty easy to implement the basic feature, but it's not working quite as we expect to display times in terms of weeks. For example, we set 6 days to be the threshold to turn into weeks - that means that after displaying "5 days", a date will switch to saying "1 week" instead of "6 days". You'd expect the "3 week" threshold to be at 7x2 + 6 = 20 days, but it's at 6x3 = 18 days, because of how the threshold values apparently work. To make it even more complicated, the 6x4 = 24 days also displays as "3 weeks", though from the pattern you'd expect that to be "4 weeks". We're in the process of figuring out / fixing these issues. I found where the tests for the method we're working on are, and wrote some more to help test our new feature and diagnose the above issues.
